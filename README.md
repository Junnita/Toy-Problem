 week1codechallenge - toy problem

## Prerequisites: 

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 

NB: **One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution**.

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

       ## Running the Solutions
Each challenge has its own folder containing a JavaScript file with the solution. To run the solutions:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coding-challenges.git
cd coding-challenges
Navigate to the folder of the challenge you want to run:

bash
Copy code
cd challenge1
Open the solution file (solution.js) in a code editor to review the implementation.

Run the solution using Node.js:

bash
Copy code
node solution.js
Follow similar steps for challenges 2 and 3 by navigating to their respective folders (challenge2, challenge3) and running their solutions.
